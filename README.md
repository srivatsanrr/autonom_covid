# COVID Infection Susceptibility prediction tool (PRATIK)
This project aims to tackle the problem of priority vaccination by providing the susceptibility of an individual to COVID-19. This is an immunological solution considering both demographic and healthcare data. We have used ML and DL algorithms to achieve a variety of results. The best results obtained were using the random forest algorithm. We have shared results using XG Boost, SVR, Logistic Regression and a few standard Neural Network architectures.
